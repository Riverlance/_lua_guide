--[=[
Nil is a type with a single value, nil, whose main property is to be different from any other value.
Lua uses nil as a kind of non-value, to represent the absence of a useful value.
As we have seen, a global variable has a nil value by default, before its first assignment,
and we can assign nil to a global variable to delete it.
